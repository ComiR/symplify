Do you maintain [a monorepo](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/) with more packages?

**This package has few useful tools, that will make that easier**.

## Install

```bash
composer require symplify/gerudoc --dev
```

## Usage

```bash
vendor/bin/gerudoc generate src --output docs/rules.md
```

And the documentation is generated in `docs/rules.md`

Happy coding!
